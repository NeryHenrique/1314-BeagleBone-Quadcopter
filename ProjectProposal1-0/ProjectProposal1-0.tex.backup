\section{Executive Summary}
\noindent The goal of this project is to create a plug-and-play quadcopter
add-on, or cape, solution for the BeagleBone Black.  With the recent explosion
of quadcopters among hobbyists and researchers, a platform that is affordable,
powerful without being overwhelming, and expandable fills a unique niche in the
current market. With the release of TI's BeagleBone Black, a very capable yet
affordable embedded processor, all three of these goals are attainable. The
successful completion of this project would result in a mechanical design for
the quadcopter frame, a BeagleBone Cape that houses sensors and motor
controllers, integrated flight control software for in-flight stabilization, and
the ability to communicate with a control base. We will be leveraging both our
resources at TI as well as the open source community throughout the course of
our project, and plan on open sourcing the mechanical designs, PCB schematic and
layout files, and source code.

\newpage
\section{Walkthrough}
\noindent The client contact at TI (currently Jason Kridner, the main software
developer on the Beagle Board/Bone platform) wants a quadcopter expansion
board/cape for the BeagleBone Black that is out of the box ready to fly or
almost ready to fly quadcopter, yet can still be expanded upon by the
hobbyist community and the users themselves. \\

\noindent The QuadCape and BeagleBone Black can be ordered on the clientâ€™s
website or through selected third party distributors. Upon delivery, the
customer will open the packaging and assemble the kit by attaching the
BeagleBone Black to the QuadCape, and attaching motors, propellers, and a
battery (all of which are either shipped with the kit or provided by the
user). \\

\noindent After enabling flight mode by pressing the on switch on the cape, an
LED will light indicating that the quadcopter has power and it's sensors have
been initialized. The quadcopter will then begin to fly; stably and slowly
raising altitude relative to its initial altitude. The user will then be able to
control the quadcopter via wireless communication: either a laptop or a mobile
device (phone or tablet). \\

\noindent To add functionality to the quadcopter, the customer can add software
through the continually evolving open source community that already exists
around the BeagleBone. The customer can also add hardware to the quadcopter
through any of the multiple ports of the BeagleBone Black by adding capes or
modifying the QuadCape board and building one themselves. If the user happens to
break anything, parts for the QuadCape or the quadcopter frame will be available
for purchase, and the design files will be published so users could build their
own replacements. Through this open source community the quadcopter will have
greater opportunity to be any type of project the client chooses, and will boost
the reputation of TI and the BeagleBone.
